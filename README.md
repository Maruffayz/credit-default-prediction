# Credit Scoring Model

This project predicts the **creditworthiness of borrowers** and estimates the **probability of default** using machine learning.

## 🧩 Key Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`  
3. Model training using Logistic Regression  
4. Evaluation with accuracy and AUC metrics  

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python  
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Git & GitHub  

## 🎯 Goal
Build a reliable credit scoring model to detect potential loan defaults.
